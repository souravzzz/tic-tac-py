- - -

tic-tac-py is a very simple implementation of the popular game, tic-tact-toe.

Currently, you can't play it against the computer, I am working on this feature, see [Branch AI](https://github.com/souravzzz/tic-tac-py/tree/ai).

#### How to play

Run it like this: `python tictac.py`

The moves are given as `row column` and the range is `0-2`
